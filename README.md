A 1-2 sentence summary or bullet points outlining your plan for check-ins throughout the duration of the project.
- Our team will primarily communicate through Slack, using messages and threads for updates.
- We'll leave comments on commits, pull requests, and GitHub Projects to track work and provide feedback.
- For more in-depth discussions, we’ll hop on Slack Huddles or Zoom calls as needed.

A 2-4 sentence summary of your plan for project organization and workflow. This can include bullet points. If you plan to use a project management tool, please include a link to your project board.
- We’re using this (GitHub Project)[https://github.com/2503-SE/futbol] board to organize tasks.
(Note: setup was not intuitive, but it’s functional now.)
- Issues are prioritized using a P0–P2 system:
-- P0: Urgent & important
-- P1: Not urgent but important
-- P2: Not urgent or important
- We’ll assign and re-assign issues based on workload and progress, updating priorities and leaving comments as needed.

A 2-3 sentence summary describing the different approaches your group discussed for project organization and how you collectively made a decision on which to use.

We discussed using Trello, a shared Google Doc/Google Drive folders, and the GitHub Projects feature. Ultimately, we agreed on using GitHub Projects so everything stays close to the codebase and allows for tighter integration with issues and pull requests. While the interface was unintuitive at first, we adapted and built a system that works for us (eventually)

A 2-3 sentence summary describing your approach to the code design.

We’re approaching the project with an asynchronous-first workflow, using GitHub Projects to manage individual and group tasks. When needed, we’ll pair program or collaborate synchronously to work through blockers or complex logic.

Include link to your initial DTR document and the date it was completed. If you do additional DTRs later in the project, you should link the revised versions here as well with the date. New versions should be listed alongside older versions. Do not delete old DTRs.
